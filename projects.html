                <p>Approaching the challenge of creating a secure, decentralized communication tool, I designed Ochlo. 
                This project focused on user privacy and ease of use, allowing for the instant creation of encrypted WLAN events without requiring user accounts.</p>

                <h3>Eugene Access</h3>
                <p>As a one-day personal design challenge, I created Eugene Access to solve a key usability problem: quickly finding essential human services. 
                    The focus was on a simple, single-screen interface for maximum accessibility and efficiency.</p>

                <p>The goal for Cash Cache was to make personal finance more engaging. I designed this income visualizer to provide clear, 
                    graphical representations of finances, turning a mundane task into a more interactive and satisfying experience.</p>
